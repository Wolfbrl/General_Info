## About Me 👋

Hello! I’m an enthusiastic beginner in the world of programming. I'm currently studying computer science and eager to expand my knowledge, especially in Python and Java. Besides coding, I have a broad interest in technology, logic, and understanding how things work. My goal is to tackle more complex projects as I improve my skills.

## Hobbies and Interests 🎮📚💻

- **Coding**: I'm particularly interested in Python and Java, and I enjoy working on projects to improve my skills.
- **Game Development**: Creating games is one of my biggest interests. The engine I am currently using is Godot.
- **Kickboxing**: You can find me in my kickboxing gym about 5-6 times a week!
- **Strategy Games**: I used to love games like Counter Strike and Team Fortress 2 but now I enjoy more chill strategy games like Plague Inc or Risk.

## Software I Use 🛠️

Here's a list of the main software and tools I use for my projects:

- **Java -> Eclipse**: Its very easy to stay organised in Eclipse. 
- **HTML/CSS -> Visual Studio Code**: What I love about VSCode is that its very easy to integrate plugins.
- **Python -> PyCharm**: This was the first IDE I used because it's easy to use and very straightforward.
- **Godot**: I love this game engine because it's fully Open Source and community driven!

## Favourite School Subjects? 📊

1. **Mathematics**: Altough it can be very challenging for me, I enjoy the process of solving a problem a lot!
2. **Cybersecurity**: Who doesn't like Cybersecurity?
3. **Object-Oriented Programming**: This is probably the reason I got into CS in the first place.
4. **Computer Systems**: In this class we primarily learn to work with the Bash Shell in Linux which I love.

## Thanks for Visiting! 🙌

Thank you for checking out my GitHub profile! I'm always open to suggestions and feedback, and I look forward to continuing my programming journey!
